We define some sub-problems and consider how to solve each of them.


\subsection*{Finding Parent Certificates}

Given \textit{sibling instances} and their \textit{certificates}, $(\phi_{left},~ \rchi_{left})$ and $(\phi_{right},~ \rchi_{right})$, such that $\rchi_{right}$ is compatible with $\phi_{left}$ and $\rchi_{left}$ is compatible with $\phi_{right}$, we can find the \textit{parent certificate}, $\rchi$ by taking the union of $\rchi_{left}$ and $\rchi_{right}$.
