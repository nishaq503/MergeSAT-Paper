We analyze the time and space complexity of the proposed algorithm.
We will proceed under the assumption that variables and their negations are uniformly distributed among clauses and that no one clause has both a variable and its negation.
This eases the analysis but it should hold even if the uniformity assumption is incorrect.


\subsection{Partitioning an Instance}
\label{subsec:partitioning-an-instance2}

We expect for $\phi_{left}$ to have $\frac{1}{n} \cdot m$ clauses from $\Phi$ and for $\phi_{right}$ to be an instance of size $(\frac{n - 1}{n} \cdot m,~ n - 1)$.
In the worst-case, $\phi_{left}$ will have $2$ clauses and $\phi_{right}$ will be an instance of size $(m - 1,~ n - 2)$.

Since this partitioning step checks for membership of two literals in each clause, it takes $\mathcal{O}(m)$ time.

\subsection{Finding Parent Certificates}
\label{subsec:finding-parent-certificates2}

$\dots$

Since there are more clauses for each certificate to satisfy, we expect a majority of certificates to be discarded in this step.
